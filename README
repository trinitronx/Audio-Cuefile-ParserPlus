NAME
    Audio::Cuefile::ParserPlus - Class to read, write & manipulate CUE files

SYNOPSIS
      use Audio::Cuefile::ParserPlus;
      Class to parse a cuefile and access all available data within.
      Can print track list, output cue files, or return a Audio::Cuefile::ParserPlus object

DESCRIPTION
      Audio::Cuefile::ParserPlus was built using the CUE sheet file specification 
      found at: 
        http://digitalx.org/cuesheetsyntax.php
      The internal data structure organizes the CUE sheet commands mainly by what are 
      considered 'global' attributes and those specific to a single 'TRACK'.
      To print track specific attributes, use the printTracks() method.

USAGE
     use Audio::Cuefile::ParserPlus;

     $filepath = 'filename.cue';

     # Create an empty object & read a file with readCUE()
     my $cuefile = new Audio::Cuefile::ParserPlus();
     $cuefile->readCUE($filepath);
     # OR specify the file in the constructor:
     my $other_cuefile = new Audio::Cuefile::ParserPlus($filepath);
     
 # Print the track data
     $cuefile->printTracks();
     $other_cuefile->printTracks();
